The Order of filling out fields is fairly self explanatory, as the Program opens up new fields as the previous fields get saved.
Fill out a field, with either one of the entries in the dropbox, or just a value that fits in the respective textbox.
Click "Save" to save your inputs. If a field gets emptied upon saving, the input was invalid.
If a character's profession is not "Adventurer", they will be left without a background or class, and the Program will skip straight to the "Finish and Save" button.
Upon having finished and saved a character, you enter a filename (and maybe a path extention with the format "Folder\filename") and click Save to File.
The resulting character file will then appear under your Desktop in the DnD\Characters folder, ready to be used and edited as necessary.
